## üöÄ Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Krish-tech08/CometChat-Demo-App.git
2. Add your CometChat Auth Key to local.properties (project root):    COMETCHAT_AUTH_KEY=your_auth_key_here
   
3. Open the project in Android Studio and build it.

   Auth Key Security Warning
‚ö†Ô∏è Do NOT hardcode your CometChat Auth Key in source files.
This project uses BuildConfig to securely inject the key at build time using local.properties.

‚ùó If you fork this project or make it public, be sure to replace or remove your Auth Key to avoid abuse.

üß† Challenges Faced
1. Theme conflict: UI Kit didn't respect night mode ‚Äì resolved by enforcing a single theme.

2. Group chat issue: Clicking on a group doesn't open the chat. Still investigating.

3. Auth key handling: Initially exposed accidentally, but removed, key rotated, and secured via local.properties.
